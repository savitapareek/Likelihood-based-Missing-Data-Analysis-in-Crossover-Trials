# Likelihood-based-missing-data-analysis-in-multivariate-crossover-trials
For gene expression data measured in a crossover trial, a multivariate mixed effects model seems to be most appropriate. Standard statistical inference fails to provide reliable results when some responses are missing. Particularly for crossover studies, missingness is a serious concern as the trial requires a small number of participants. A Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) based technique has been adopted to deal with this situation. Along with estimation, a MCEM likelihood ratio test (LRTs) is developed for testing the fixed effects in such a multivariate crossover model with missing data. Intensive simulation studies have been carried out prior to the analysis of the gene expression data.  Keywords: Multivariate crossover trials; Monte Carlo EM algorithm; MCEM LRTs;
